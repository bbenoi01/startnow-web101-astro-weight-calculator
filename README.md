Welcome!
Thank you for visiting my Astro Weight Calculator. This little program is designed to tell you how much a person (or object) with a given weight, would weigh on other plantes and celestial bodies.

How to open:

In your command prompt, enter 'code ~/oca/startnow-web101-astro-weight calculator' and press enter. This will open the project in visual studio code. To test this application, run static.
